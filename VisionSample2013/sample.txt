FRC 2013 Vision Sample Program
--------------------------------
This project is a camera vision sample that detects the Middle and High goal vision targets in
the 2013 FRC game. Look at the comments in the code and the Vision Processing section of the
documentation at http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com. Look in the VisionImages directory
inside the project that is created for sample images as well as the NI Vision Assistant file
that contains the vision command chain (open it with the Vision Assistant).
